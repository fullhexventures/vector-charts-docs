This completes account creation. You will be redirected to the Vector Charts cloud, which you can login to any time at [https://cloud.vectorcharts.com/](https://cloud.vectorcharts.com/).

## 3. Setup Billing

By default, Vector Charts accounts are on the free tier. This tier does not require a credit card, but will reject API requests above the free limit defined in our [Pricing](https://vectorcharts.com/pricing/).


To use Vector Charts above the free usage tier, you must add a payment method.

Navigate to the Settings page, and click Edit Payment Method.

Enter a credit card number for payment, and click Confirm:

Your credit card will be saved for payment. The card will not be billed until you go over the free usage tier.

For more information on tracking your usage and billing settings, see the [Billing](/getting-started/billing/) section.
